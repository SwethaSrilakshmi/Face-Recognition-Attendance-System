This project aims at taking attendance of a class through a Face recognition based attendance system.

This Project has three modules: 

The FDWI (Face Detection Webcam Input) module is used to provide the needed image inputs to the system. The ‘Analysis’ module is used to analyse the image information and to identify the students. The Report Generation module is used to create the attendance report at the end.

The main logic of the system involves in the utilization of image cascading technique to compare the faces in the given class image, with the images in the file system, one by one using an iterative structure.

The project uses report lab tool generate the output report, in .pdf form. This Report contains the students attended to the class along with their Rollnos.
